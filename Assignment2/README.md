# Assignment 2: Data Flow Analysis

1. Derive a formalization for the Dataflow Analysis framework, filling in the table with the appropriate parameters relative to $\rightarrow$ **Very Busy Expression, Dominator Analysis, and Constant Propagation.**

2. For the CFGs given as example, populate a table with the iterations of the algorithm that solves the problem.
